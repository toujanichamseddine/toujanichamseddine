Give me an advice, in my project I have 2 modules:
- server: java spring backend , exposing rest web service using java.ws.rs and protected by SAML, with /espm/rest/**
- admin: web angular project , with acess /admin

What's should protect by SAML?
- only /admin and i create a session to allow access for /espm/rest/** web service
or
- Secure /espm/rest/** and make a condition for pages on /admin to show or hide coming from backend

if you have an other solution, tell me
